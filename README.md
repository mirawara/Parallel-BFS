<p id="description">This project is a parallel implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for graph traversal using CUDA programming on NVIDIA GPUs. The goal is to improve the performance of BFS on large-scale graphs by exploiting the parallelism of GPUs. The project includes a detailed analysis of the algorithm, implementation, kernel profile, and performance evaluation. The implementation is optimized using various techniques such as memory coalescing, thread work distribution, and shared memory usage. The kernel profile analysis provides insights into the performance bottlenecks and helps in optimizing the implementation further. The performance evaluation is done on various graphs of different sizes and densities, and the results show significant speedup compared to the sequential BFS algorithm on CPU. See the <a href="https://github.com/mirawara/Parallel-BFS/Wiki/BFS-Wiki">Wiki</a> for further details.
